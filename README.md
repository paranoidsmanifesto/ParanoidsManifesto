## Philosophy

Most individuals have interacted with an internet-facing device before, in which the device was most-likely compromised. Regarding those same individuals, it is most definite that they are still interacting with compromised internet-facing devices. As a Paranoid, you must ensue the following values into your everyday activites:

#### You Are Never Safe

todo: Firmware blobs, hardware backdoors, phones, computers, operating systems, etc.

#### You Are Always Being Watched

todo: Five/Nine/Fourteen Eyes, mass surveillance programs, CCTV (gait, facial recognition, greyman, routine, bodily recognition), PII, device sensors, etc.

#### You Cannot Trust Anyone

todo: "Friends", politicians, family, coworkers, educators, partners, etc.

#### (If) You Cannot See It, You Do Not Own It

todo: SaaS, free software, DRM, etc.

#### (If) You Cannot Question It, It Is Propaganda

todo: Education, political messages, etc.

## Justification

todo: Why do we do this?

## Taking The Offensive

todo: How to reclaim your privacy, maintaining your anonymity, zero trust, etc.
